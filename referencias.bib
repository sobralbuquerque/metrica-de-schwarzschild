abstract = {Suitable for a one-semester course in general relativity for senior undergraduates or beginning graduate students, this text clarifies the mathematical aspects of Einstein's theory of relativity without sacrificing physical understanding. The text begins with an exposition of those aspects of tensor calculus and differential geometry needed for a proper treatment of the subject. The discussion then turns to the spacetime of general relativity and to geodesic motion. A brief consideration of the field equations is followed by a discussion of physics in the vicinity of massive objects, including an elementary treatment of black holes and rotating objects. The main text concludes with introductory chapters on gravitational radiation and cosmology. This new third edition has been updated to take account of fresh observational evidence and experiments. It includes new sections on the Kerr solution (in Chapter 4) and cosmological speeds of recession (in Chapter 6). A more mathematical treatment of tensors and manifolds, included in the 1st edition, but omitted in the 2nd edition, has been restored in an appendix. Also included are two additional appendixes â€“ "Special Relativity Review" and "The Chinese Connection" - and outline solutions to all exercises and problems, making it especially suitable for private study.},

@incollection{Dray2012,
abstract = {The $\backslash$booktitle{\{}Geometry of Special Relativity{\}}$\backslash$nprovides an introduction to special relativity that$\backslash$nencourages readers to see beyond the formulas to the$\backslash$ndeeper geometric structure. The text treats the$\backslash$ngeometry of hyperbolas as the key to understanding$\backslash$nspecial relativity. This approach replaces the$\backslash$nubiquitous $\Gamma$ symbol of most standard$\backslash$ntreatments with the appropriate hyperbolic$\backslash$ntrigonometric functions. In most cases, this not only$\backslash$nsimplifies the appearance of the formulas, but also$\backslash$nemphasizes their geometric content in such a way as to$\backslash$nmake them almost obvious. Furthermore, many important$\backslash$nrelations, including the famous relativistic addition$\backslash$nformula for velocities, follow directly from the$\backslash$nappropriate trigonometric addition formulas. The book$\backslash$nfirst describes the basic physics of special relativity$\backslash$nto set the stage for the geometric treatment that$\backslash$nfollows. It then reviews properties of ordinary$\backslash$ntwo-dimensional Euclidean space, expressed in terms of$\backslash$nthe usual circular trigonometric functions, before$\backslash$npresenting a similar treatment of two-dimensional$\backslash$nMinkowski space, expressed in terms of hyperbolic$\backslash$ntrigonometric functions. After covering special$\backslash$nrelativity again from the geometric point of view, the$\backslash$ntext discusses standard paradoxes, applications to$\backslash$nrelativistic mechanics, the relativistic unification of$\backslash$nelectricity and magnetism, and further steps leading to$\backslash$nEinstein's general theory of relativity. The book also$\backslash$nbriefly describes the further steps leading to$\backslash$nEinstein's general theory of relativity and then$\backslash$nexplores applications of hyperbola geometry to$\backslash$nnon-Euclidean geometry and calculus, including a$\backslash$ngeometric construction of the derivatives of$\backslash$ntrigonometric functions and the exponential function.},

@book{Schutz2009,
abstract = {Clarity, readability and rigor combine in the second edition of this widely-used textbook to provide the first step into general relativity for undergraduate students with a minimal background in mathematics. Topics within relativity that fascinate astrophysical researchers and students alike are covered with Schutz's characteristic ease and authority - from black holes to gravitational lenses, from pulsars to the study of the Universe as a whole. This edition now contains discoveries by astronomers that require general relativity for their explanation; a revised chapter on relativistic stars, including new information on pulsars; an entirely rewritten chapter on cosmology; and an extended, comprehensive treatment of modern detectors and expected sources. Over 300 exercises, many new to this edition, give students the confidence to work with general relativity and the necessary mathematics, whilst the informal writing style makes the subject matter easily accessible.
